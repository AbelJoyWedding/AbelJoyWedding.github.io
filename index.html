                    Ordinary Love Story
                </h3>
                <p class="text reveal">In Daejeon’s gentle embrace, two paths converged, <br>
One from Seoul’s bustling rhythm, the other a mission emerged. <br>
In a humble restaurant, beneath the evening glow, <br>
Destiny wove threads neither could know. <br>
 <br>
Her laughter, like sunlight, lit the room so bright, <br>
Her caring heart, a beacon in the quiet night. <br>
He couldn’t look away, his heart struck anew, <br>
A spark ignited, a dream breaking through. <br>
 <br>
Cafés became their haven, where worlds intertwined, <br>
Language and love blossomed, hearts combined. <br>
She taught him her words; he shared his delight, <br>
Each moment together felt perfectly right. <br>
 <br>
But the tides of life pulled him back to the West, <br>
Leaving behind the one who had captured his quest. <br>
Yet fortune favored, as fate often dares— <br>
She was bound for the States, with dreams to share. <br>
 <br>
To New York she came, her spirit bold, <br>
While he forged a new path in the tech world’s fold. <br>
Reunited at last, in that city of dreams, <br>
Their love grew stronger, like rushing streams. <br>
 <br>
Now they stand, hand in hand, ready to begin, <br>
A life together, where love always wins. <br>
Through every journey, every twist, every turn, <br>
Their hearts remain aflame, forever to burn.</p>
